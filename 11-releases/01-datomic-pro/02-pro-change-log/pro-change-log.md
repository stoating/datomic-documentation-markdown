# Datomic Pro Change Log

## Read This First

- This document covers all releases. For a summary of critical release notices only, see [Release Notices](../../releases.md).
- Releases with four version number components are bugfix **only**: releases based on their three-component parents, e.g. 0.8.4020.24 is a bugfix release for 0.8.4020. When upgrading, you should always choose the highest-numbered bugfix release in a family of releases.
- The Datomic team recommends that you always test new releases in a staging environment first.
- The Datomic team recommends that you always take a backup before adopting a new release.

## 1.0.7556: 2026/03/13

| Artifact | Release Date | Version | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| `datomic-pro-1.0.7556.zip` | 2026/03/13 | 1.0.7556 | [Download](https://datomic-pro-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/1.0.7556/datomic-pro-1.0.7556.zip) |
| `[com.datomic/peer "1.0.7556"]` | 2026/03/13 | 1.0.7556 | `Copy Peer dep` |

- Fix: Prevent issue when running both io-stats and query-stats where `:ret` would nest.
- Performance: Significantly reduce CPU and memory allocation of Datomic's memory-size routine.
- Dependency upgrade: Datomic now uses AWS Java SDK v2, and has removed dependencies on v1.

Peers connecting to DynamoDB storage must depend on `software.amazon.awssdk/dynamodb {:mvn/version "2.31.45"}`.

Apps that use AWS SDK v1 classes `com.amazonaws.*` implicitly should make explicit their dependency on v1 libraries or migrate usages to v2.

If your application uses certain logging backends, AWS Java SDK v2 requires these minimum versions:

- logback-classic -> 1.4.14
- org.slf4j/slf4j-jdk14 -> 1.7.36
- org.slf4j/slf4j-log4j12 -> 1.7.36

## 1.0.7491: 2026/01/26

| `[com.datomic/peer "1.0.7491"]` | 2026/01/26 | 1.0.7491 | `Copy Peer dep` |

- Fix: Ignore component relationships established after an excision request.
- Performance: excision-repair-tool reporting and repairing performance is significantly improved.

## 1.0.7482: 2026/01/06

| Artifact | Release Date | Version | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| `datomic-pro-1.0.7482.zip` | 2026/01/06 | 1.0.7482 | [Download](https://datomic-pro-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/1.0.7482/datomic-pro-1.0.7482.zip) |
| `[com.datomic/peer "1.0.7482"]` | 2026/01/06 | 1.0.7482 | `Copy Peer dep` |

- Performance: Improve indexing performance, reduce I/O in large databases.

## 1.0.7469: 2025/10/23

| Artifact | Release Date | Version | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| `datomic-pro-1.0.7469.zip` | 2025/10/23 | 1.0.7469 | [Download](https://datomic-pro-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/1.0.7469/datomic-pro-1.0.7469.zip) |
| `[com.datomic/peer "1.0.7469"]` | 2025/10/23 | 1.0.7469 | `Copy Peer dep` |

- Fix: Indexing slowly leaks garbage segments in storage which are unrecoverable by `gc-storage`.
- Fix: excisions may not be completely applied to [as-of](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#datomic.api/as-of) or [history](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#datomic.api/history) database values.

Datomic Release 1.0.7469 fixes a bug that prevented excisions from removing datoms from the [as-of](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#datomic.api/as-of) or [history](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#datomic.api/history) indexes. This release also includes a tool to detect incomplete excisions to the index and optionally re-apply them. This bug only affects databases that contain excision datoms (`:db/excise`). This bug does not affect ordinary database values (those without [as-of](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#datomic.api/as-of) or [history](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#datomic.api/history)), nor the transaction log.

See: [Excision Repair Tool](../../releases.md#excision-repair-tool).

The tool works in both report and repair modes while the transactor runs. The tool needs read permissions to storage, like a peer. Repair mode requires write permissions.

## 0.9.4899: 2014/09/09

- New: the transactor and peer now require Clojure 1.6.0 or greater.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a transactor to become unresponsive after waking from laptop sleep.

## 0.9.4894: 2014/08/26

- New: transactor configuration setting to disable printing of credentials. Specify the boolean system property `datomic.printConnectionInfo` as `false` to disable. The default is true.

Transactor properties documentation can be found at [System Properties](../../../05-operation/01-pro/10-system-properties/system-properties.md).

- Fixed bug that prevented nested map `db/id` overrides with string keys.
- Fixed a bug that could cause extra sessions to be created against Cassandra storage.
- This release optimizes the repair job introduced in 0.9.4880 to minimize its impact on live systems.

## 0.9.4880: 2014/08/21

- Fixed bug where some indexed retractions are not enforced. This can cause old values to reappear, or uniqueness constraints to consider retracted values. Upgrading the transactor to this release will repair the problem during the next indexing job.
- Delay accepting V-only bindings in query ordering.
- Provide better error messages when backup/restore directory does not exist.
- Upgraded cassandra-driver-core to 2.0.3. This update fixes a bug in Cassandra that was causing it to leak file descriptors as described [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6275).
- Added more logging around keys being written to storage.
- Added an error message when peers see no heartbeat.
- Added better error message when the value associated with the key is unavailable to be read from storage.
- Fixed bug where processes would sometimes prefer an old ident over a new one after a restart.
- SQL storage users can now configure the pool validation query via `datomic.sqlValidationQuery`, default is "SELECT 1".
- Re-enable metrics that were inadvertently disabled in 0.9.4815, e.g. `StorageGetMsec` and `StoragePutMsec`.
- Integrity validations added in newer versions of Datomic no longer prevent loading older non-compliant databases.

## 0.9.4815: 2014/08/13

- Transactors now use the G1 garbage collector and require Java 7 or later. Peers continue to work with Java 6 or later.
- Database backups to S3 can now use `-encryption sse` to request server-side encryption.
- Better defaults and more configuration options for I/O utilization during backup and restore. [The Defaults](../../../05-operation/01-pro/07-backup-and-restore/backup-and-restore.md#performance) are now good for most scenarios.
- Updated AMIs across all regions with current Amazon Linux distributions and support for HVM-based instances.
- Added support for more Amazon instance types.
- Prevented race condition in `deleteDatabase` that could tie up a thread writing error messages in the log.
- Fixed bug where peers that were offline during a transaction would not see fulltext for the offline time until the next indexing job was completed.
- **NOTE:** Better protection against retracting schema entities. If you encounter the following error:

  ```
  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: :db.error/invalid-install-attribute
  at datomic.error-arg.invoke(error.clj:55)
  at datomic.db-install_attribute_hook.invoke(db.clj:1034)
  at datomic.db-run_hooks-fn__3689.invoke(db.clj:1849)
  ```

  then you may have incorrectly retracted a schema entity. Contact support@cognitect.com for assistance recovering from this error.

- Protection against placing non-schema entities in the `:db.part/db` partition. If you see the following error message:

  "Only schema components can be installed in partition :db.part/db"

  you will need to correct your program to create non-schema entities in `:db.part/user` or a partition you create.

- Fixed bug that prevented compilation of some `:require` forms in data functions.

## 0.9.4766: 2014/05/21

- New built-in [query expressions](../../../06-reference/03-query-and-pull/02-query-reference/query-reference.md#expression-clauses): `get-else`, `get-some`, `ground`, and `missing`.
- Added support for memcached-sasl, check [Caching](../../../05-operation/01-pro/08-memory-and-caching/memory-and-caching.md) for details.
- Allow lookup refs for V position in users of VAET index, including `:db.fn/retractEntity`.
- String representation for Connection no longer throws an exception if the connection is closed.

## 0.9.4755: 2014/04/23

Re-enable input-bound rule predicates.

## 0.9.4752: 2014/04/22

- Fixes for parallelism in query function expressions.
- Fixes variable-less entity clauses.

## 0.9.4745: 2014/04/19

Fixed bug where systems using adaptive indexing could become unavailable with the following exception on both transactors and peers:

```text
java.lang.NullPointerException: null
at datomic.db-find_last_tx.invoke(db.clj:1875)
at datomic.db-db.invoke(db.clj:1885)
```

All users of adaptive indexing (0.9.4699 or greater) are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release. Both transactors and peers need to be upgraded, but it's not necessary to upgrade them simultaneously.

## 0.9.4724: 2014/04/16

This release upgrades the backup format to improve backup capacity against large databases. Datomic now stores backups using a subdirectory structure.

0.9.4724 can restore backups taken by previous versions of Datomic. However, previous versions of Datomic will not be able to restore newer backups.

## 0.9.4718: 2014/04/15

More query optimizations. Keeps single-valued `:in` clauses at top.

## 0.9.4714: 2014/04/14

Query optimizations.

## 0.9.4707: 2014/04/08

- Fixed bug in peer object cache management that could result in OOM errors with large (> 2GB) caches.
- Better error reporting for storage failures.
- Allow configuration of transactor KeyStore and TrustStore to facilitate encrypted communication with [Storages](../../../05-operation/01-pro/01-storage-services/storage-services.md).

## 0.9.4699: 2014/03/24

- New feature: [adaptive indexing](https://blog.datomic.com/2014/03/datomic-adaptive-indexing.html). Check [upgrading](../../releases.md).
- Renamed metric: `AlarmTxStalledIndexing` is now `AlarmBackPressure`.
- Fixed default region in CloudFormation template.

## 0.9.4609: 2014/04/08

- Upgraded HornetQ dependency to 2.3.17.Final. Due to changes in HornetQ, this release is incompatible with previous releases of Datomic. Both peers and transactors will need to be upgraded together.
- Updated Guava dependency to 16.0.1.

## 0.9.4578: 2014/03/24

- Fixed bug where adding `:db/index` sometimes would not take effect. If you encounter this error, upgrade to this release then drop and read the index.
- Tighter validation around invalid schema changes.

## 0.9.4572: 2014/03/13

- Prevent out-of-memory errors with very large indexing jobs, particularly those that are adding new AVET indexes.
- Release JDBC resources more aggressively when using SQL storage.

## 0.9.4556: 2014/03/05

- New feature: [lookup refs](https://blog.datomic.com/2014/02/datomic-lookup-refs.html).
- Fixed bug where the transaction tempid would not resolve correctly when used only in value position.
- Fixed bug where peers could leak resources trying to connect to databases that have been deleted.
- More detailed error messages for some invalid transactions.
- Raise the enforced level of the total number of schema elements (such as attributes, partitions, and types) to be fewer than 2^20.

---

0.9.4532 includes an upgrade to the log format that requires simultaneous update of peers and transactors, and is not compatible with older versions, see below:

## 0.9.4532: 2014/02/24

This release upgrades the database log to format version 2.

- All peers and transactors in a system must move together to this version or later.
- The transactor and peers are backward compatible with log version 1. Transactors will automatically upgrade database logs to version 2 when a database is used. The performance cost of this upgrade is negligible and upgrades can be performed against production systems.

Older versions of the peer and transactor are -not- forward compatible with log version 2, and will report the following error:

```text
NullPointerException java.util.UUID.fromString
```

Downgrading to log version 1 is possible. This release includes a command line tool that can be used to downgrade a database to log version 1:

```sh
bin/datomic revert-to-log-version-1 {your-database-uri}
```

- Fixed bug where, after a transactor failure, Datomic processes could fail to start with a "Gap in data" exception.
- Fixed performance problem with `variance` and `sttdev` query aggregation functions.
- Limited thread use in query.

## 0.9.4497: 2014/02/07

- Improvements to the [REST](../../../04-apis/09-rest-api/rest-api.md) client.
- Added a GettingStarted.groovy sample in the samples/seattle directory.
- Added SSL support for [Riak and Cassandra](../../../05-operation/01-pro/01-storage-services/storage-services.md).
- Improved script for launching transactor to allow for cleaner process management.
- Improved built-in Compare-and-Swap performance.
- Datomic now enforces the total number of schema elements (such as attributes, partitions, and types) to be fewer than 32k.

## 0.9.4470: 2014/01/29

- New Feature: [alter schema](https://blog.datomic.com/2014/01/schema-alteration.html). This feature breaks compatibility with older versions. Once a schema alteration has been performed on a database, only connect peers and transactors running at least version 0.9.4470 to that database.
- New API: database.[attribute](../../../04-apis/02-peer-api-javadoc/interfaces/database/database.md#attribute-java.lang.Object-) and [Attribute](../../../04-apis/02-peer-api-javadoc/interfaces/attribute/attribute.md).
- New APIs: [connection.syncIndex / syncSchema / syncExcise](../../../04-apis/02-peer-api-javadoc/interfaces/connection/connection.md).
- Datomic will now reject some unworkable memory settings, e.g. combinations of memory-index-max and object-cache-max that exceed 75% of JVM RAM.
- Added validation to prevent conflicting unique value assertions within a transaction.
- Fixed bug that prevented Datomic Console from working with Riak or Cassandra storage.
- Better logging for Riak storage.

## 0.9.4384: 2014/01/23

Preliminary support for [Cassandra Storage](../../../05-operation/01-pro/01-storage-services/storage-services.md).

## 0.9.4360: 2013/12/18

- Used jarjar to move Datomic's use of Apache Lucene to package names that will not conflict with the application use of Lucene.

## 0.9.4353: 2013/12/12

- Updated to aws-java-sdk 1.6.6.
- Datomic now supports DynamoDB Local as a development-time [Storage](../../../05-operation/01-pro/01-storage-services/storage-services.md) option.
- Datomic transactions now validate that tempids have a valid partition.
- Fixed bug where some transactions would timeout unnecessarily, even though the work was completed by the transactor.
- Fixed bug where fulltext queries did not find answers in the history database.

## 0.9.4331: 2013/12/09

- Made transactor more robust against transient SQL storage connection failures.
- Fixed bug where transactor would log a spurious NPE from datomic.hornet during shutdown.

## 0.9.4324: 2013/11/27

- Fixed a bug in IAM roles support that prevented automatic renewal of role credentials in one case.
- Fixed a bug in the build process that caused the 0.9.4314 version of the Console to be non-operational.

## 0.9.4314: 2013/11/25

- IAM roles are now the preferred way to supply credentials when running Datomic in AWS. See [Storage](../../../05-operation/01-pro/01-storage-services/storage-services.md) to configure a new transactor using IAM roles. Check [migrate-to-roles](../../../05-operation/01-pro/11-running-on-aws/running-on-aws.md) to migrate an existing Datomic configuration to use IAM roles.
- The transactor now supports a mechanism for integrating different monitoring services, see the 'Custom Monitoring' section of [monitoring](../../../05-operation/01-pro/05-monitoring-and-performance/monitoring-and-performance.md).
- Updated Riak client to 1.4.2.
- Cloudwatch and custom monitoring now report the count of `RemotePeers`.

## 0.8.4270: 2013/11/18

- Fixed bug where large excisions could prevent subsequent storage garbage collection.
- Fixed bug where Datomic Pro eval keys did not have access to HA.
- Datomic now verifies Lucene major version without using package reflection (fixes inability to uberjar 4260).
- Updated Fressian dependency to 0.6.5.
- Better error message on nil input to query.

## 0.8.4260: 2013/11/07

- Make sure Util.read preloads schema-reading helpers, so that schemas can be read before touching a database.
- Fixed bug in connection pool validator for Oracle SQL storage.

## 0.8.4254: 2013/10/29

- New: [Datomic Console](../../../10-resources/03-datomic-pro-console/datomic-pro-console.md).
- More consistent use of [error handling](../../../04-apis/13-error-handling/error-handling.md) throughout API.
- Quicker detection of transactor disconnects, reported to peers via exceptions in transaction futures and sync futures.
- Fixed bug in 4215, 4218 that caused `IllegalStateException` when calling `Util.read`.
- Corrected sa-east-1 transactor AMI ID.

## 0.8.4218: 2013/10/11

Fixed bug where transaction promises could be garbage collected before a transaction completes, preventing `ListenableFuture` callbacks from firing.

## 0.8.4215: 2013/10/01

Improved redundancy elimination. If a transaction presents a datom that is identical (except for tx) to an existing datom, that datom will not be added to the log.

## 0.8.4159: 2013/09/10

- Updated aws-java-sdk dependency to 1.5.5, discontinued using jets3t.
- Reduced background thread usage in query.
- Transactions now convert doubles to floats when attribute schema requires floats.
- Transactor heartbeat is now more robust in the face of transient failures writing to storage.

## 0.8.4143: 2013/08/22

- `:db/noHistory` is now respected by indexer.
- More precise docstring for `:db/noHistory`.

## 0.8.4138: 2013/08/14

- Improved transactor performance, specifically around memory usage and GC pauses. This includes improved memory efficiency in indexing, and a new set of GC flags in bin/transactor.
- Fixed bug where queries with constants in V position could return too many results.
- Transactor does more useful logging at the INFO level, so there should be less need to modify the logging configuration.

## 0.8.4122: 2013/08/03

- New: API for accessing the [log](../../../04-apis/08-log-api/log-api.md).
- Return correct result from REST avet datoms call when neither start nor end are provided.
- Eliminate spurious file bin/logback-test.xml that was incorrectly included in 0.8.4111.

## 0.8.4111: 2013/07/31

- New: memory settings for the transactor must be explicitly specified in the transactor properties file. There are no default settings, so existing transactor property files that lack these settings will no longer work. The transactor properties sample files include three complete examples, representing ongoing usage, one-time imports, and constrained-memory usage during development.
- New: stricter validation of datoms within a single transaction, preventing duplication of the same datom and multiple assertions of cardinality-one attributes. This will cause transactions that would formerly have succeeded to fail with a validation error.
- New: the transactor and peer now require Clojure 1.5.1 or greater.
- New: peer configuration setting for peer/transactor connection timeout. Specify system property `datomic.peerConnectionTTLMsec` in milliseconds. Default and minimum are both 10000.
- New: Reverse attribute lookups from an entity are returned as sets.
- Transactors are now more robust in the face of transient errors writing to storage.
- `touch` now works correctly for component entities that have `:db/ident`.

- Updated jetty dependencies (used in REST server).

## 0.8.4020.26: 2013/07/09

- Fixed bug that prevented zero-argument data functions in Java.
- Fixed bug where peers have trouble connecting when already-connected peers are producing a heavy write load.

## 0.8.4020.24: 2013/07/01

- Fixed bug in 0.8.4020 where nested collections of preexisting entity ids were incorrectly rejected by the transactor, with a "Unable to interpret … as a reference target" message.
- Fixed bug in 0.8.4020 where use of a transaction entity in value position only leads to background indexing failure on the transactor.

## 0.8.4020: 2013/06/19

- [Component entities can now be created as nested maps in transaction data](https://blog.datomic.com/2013/06/component-entities.html).
- Tightened peer HornetQ timeout for faster failover.
- Allow sets as an alternative to lists when specifying values for a cardinality-many attribute in transaction data.
- Fixed bug: Allow the transaction entity to appear in value position only in transaction data.
- Fixed bug: Prevent excessive memory use that would occur before rejecting an invalid transaction that attempts `db.fn/retractEntity` nil.

## 0.8.4007: 2013/06/12

- Updated several library dependencies to more recent versions: aws, guava, h2, logback, netty, and slf4j.
- Better `toString` representations for objects likely to be encountered in shell (e.g. groovysh) sessions.

## 0.8.3993: 2013/06/03

- Increased parallelism in query.
- New API: [connection.sync](https://blog.datomic.com/2013/06/sync.html).
- Connection.db now returns a database immediately, even if the transactor is unavailable.
- Improved peer recovery time during [HA](../../../05-operation/01-pro/06-high-availability/high-availability.md) failover.

## 0.8.3971: 2013/05/23

- Fixed bug where some active log segments are marked as garbage, which can result in log corruption after a call to `gcStorage`. Moving to this release is strongly advised.
- Improved CloudWatch metric: `IndexWrites` is now reported once per indexing job, making it easier to reason about per-index-job load.
- New CloudWatch metric: `TransactionBatch` tracks the number of transactions batched into a single write to the log.
- New CloudWatch metric: `MemoryIndexFillMsec` reports an estimate of the time to fill the memory index, given the current write load.

## 0.8.3970: 2013/05/23

(Do not use this release).

## 0.8.3960: 2013/05/20

Fixed a bug where indexing jobs could fail for fulltext attributes.

## 0.8.3952: 2013/05/16

- Fixed bug where HA transactor pool can become stuck and no transactor can start. All HA users should adopt this release as soon as possible.
- Mark log segments as garbage after excision. Note that .gcStorage is still a necessary separate step.
- Improved efficiency in writing transaction logs.
- Quickly report pending transactions failed if the transactor connection is lost.

## 0.8.3941: 2013/05/10

- [Excision](../../../05-operation/01-pro/14-excision/excision.md).

## 0.8.3899: 2013/05/08

Fixed bug where background index creation could fail to trigger in systems running multiple databases, eventually resulting in the need to restart transactor.

## 0.8.3895: 2013/04/26

- Fixed bug where, after a cold restart of transactor, peer could attempt transactions that would arrive before the transactor was ready and timeout.
- Fixed bug that caused "Database deleted" error when deleting and recreating databases in development.
- Fixed bug in CloudFormation template creation that required explicit setting of `java-opts` property, even when defaults acceptable.
- Added missing AWS instance sizes to CloudFormation template generator.
- Upgraded to AWS Java SDK 1.4.1.

## 0.8.3862: 2013/03/29

Fixed incorrect validation introduced in 0.8.3861 that prevented asserting the attribute value `false`.

## 0.8.3861: 2013/03/27

- New API `Peer.shutdown`.
- New API `Connection.release`.
- Fixed spurious error after heartbeat failure on transactor.

- Prevent aggressive timeout in Peer.connect that could occur when connecting to cold transactor + slow log ingest.
- Allowed peers to ingest log in parallel with ingest on a cold transactor.
- Added LogIngestMsec and LogIngestBytes Cloudwatch metrics. See [monitoring](../../../05-operation/01-pro/05-monitoring-and-performance/monitoring-and-performance.md) for more on metrics.
- Renamed system property `datomic.objectCacheBytes` to `datomic.objectCacheMax` for consistency with other property names. See [capacity](../../../05-operation/01-pro/04-capacity-planning/capacity-planning.md) for more on capacity-related properties.

## 0.8.3803: 2013/02/12

- Include command-line utility JARs that were inadvertently omitted in 0.8.3784.

## 0.8.3784: 2013/02/01

- Improved indexing performance: lower memory use on the transactor, and higher transaction throughput during indexing jobs.
- New [deployment documentation](../../../05-operation/01-pro/03-datomic-deployment/datomic-deployment.md).
- New transactor memory setting `memory-index-threshold`, and expanded documentation at [capacity](../../../05-operation/01-pro/04-capacity-planning/capacity-planning.md).
- Overhauled the metrics reported by the transactor. Learn about the new metrics at [monitoring](../../../05-operation/01-pro/05-monitoring-and-performance/monitoring-and-performance.md).
- Fixed bug that caused incomplete garbage collection of storage on DynamoDB.

## 0.8.3767: 2013/01/23

- Fixed bug where deleting a database could cause subsequent indexing jobs of other databases to fail with "No implementation of method: :queue-database-index …"
- New `Alarm` metric is fired whenever the transactor encounters a problem that requires manual intervention.
- Improved indexing performance, particularly for larger strings and binary values.

## 0.8.3731: 2013/01/09

- Improved resilience in the face of unreliable or throttled storage.
- Added write-concurrency setting to the transactor properties file, which can be used to limit the number of concurrent writes to storage.
- Added StorageBackoff metric, which records the amount of time spent backing off and waiting for storage.
- Fixed bug where fulltext queries would sometimes seek off the end of an index and throw IOException.

## 0.8.3705: 2013/01/09 - Breaking change to peer/transactor communication

Upgrade to HornetQ 2.2.21. This change breaks compatibility with older versions, so peers and transactors must be upgraded together.

## 0.8.3704: 2013/01/03

Fixed bug in HA support. HA does not work with the three previous releases (3692, 3664, 3655). If you are running a standby transactor for HA, make sure to upgrade to this release.

## 0.8.3692: 2012/12/28

- Fixed bug where restore would restore to a version other than the most recent in the backup storage.
- Improved backup CLI: You can now `list-backups` to see different points in time (t) that are backed up to a storage, and pass a `t` argument to `restore-db` to restore from a version other than the most recent in the backup storage.
- Fixed bug: all transaction errors now throw exceptions consistent with the API documentation. (Some errors had been thrown early, on transact, rather than on dereferencing the transaction future.)
- Fixed a bug where a portion of the history index was not considered by the `asOf` database filter.
- Fixed bug where, under unusual circumstances, datoms could reappear in the present index, even though they had been retracted.
- Performance optimization: Peer cache now reads ahead on indexes.
- Updated to spymemcached 2.8.9.
- Fixed bug where retraction of a nonexistent fulltext attribute value could cause subsequent indexing jobs to fail.
- Fixed a bug that could prevent connection to a database after a cycle of create / backup / delete / restore.

## 0.8.3664: 2012/12/15

Added gap-detection validation when reading log on startup. Operating with a gap, while not resulting in loss of data, can cause violations of uniqueness and cardinality constraints. Users on releases prior to 0.8.3664 are strongly encouraged to move to 0.8.3664 or later as soon as possible.

## 0.8.3655: 2012/12/12

- Fixed bug where entities could have more than one `:db/fn` attribute.
- Fixed bug in log loading where a window of data could be invisible on restart, even though that data is present in the log.

## 0.8.3646: 2012/12/09

- Fixed bug where database indexing fails after a backup/restore cycle.
- Fixed bug in Clojure API where transaction futures sometimes would return (rather than throw) an exception.
- Fixed bug in Java API where transaction futures would occasionally return an object that is not the documented map.
- Better error reporting for some kinds of invalid queries.
- Alpha support for CORS in the REST service. Note that the bin/rest args have changed. See [rest](../../../04-apis/09-rest-api/rest-api.md) for details.

## 0.8.3627: 2012/11/27

- Fixed bug where the first restore of a database to a new storage did not include the most recent data, even though that data was present in the backup. (Subsequent restores were unaffected).
- Queries now take a `:with` clause, to specify variables to be kept in the aggregation set but not returned.
- Database.filter predicates now take two arguments: The unfiltered Database value and the Datom.
- You can now retrieve the Database that is the basis of an entity with Entity.db.
- You can now install a release of Datomic Pro into your local Maven repository with `bin/maven-install`.

## 0.8.3619: 2012/11/21

- Alpha release of Database.filter, which returns a value of the database filtered to contain only the datoms satisfying a predicate.
- New AWS metric: IndexWrites.
- Peers no longer need to include a Datomic-specific Maven repository, as [Fressian](https://github.com/Datomic/fressian) is now available from Maven Central and clojars.

## 0.8.3611: 2012/11/19

- Added memory-index-max setting to allow higher throughput for e.g. import jobs.

## 0.8.3546: 2012/10/09

Alpha support for aggregation functions in query.

## 0.8.3538: 2012/09/21

- Fixed bug where variables bound by a query :in clause were not seen as bound inside rules.
- Added `invoke` API for invoking database functions.

## 0.8.3524: 2012/09/16

## 0.8.3520: 2012/09/14

- Fixed but that prevented the catalog page from loading on REST service when running against a persistent storage.
- Enhancements to REST documentation.

## 0.8.3511: 2012/09/14

The REST service is now its documentation. Just point a browser at the root of the server:port on which you started the service. Note that the "web app" that results **is** the service. It is not an app built on the service, nor a set of documentation pages about the service. The URIs, query params, and POST data are the same ones you will use when accessing the service programmatically.

## 0.8.3488: 2012/09/06

Initial version of REST service.

## 0.8.3479: 2012/09/04

- Fixed bug where peers could continue to interact with connections to deleted databases.
- Fixed query bug where constants in queries were not correctly joined with answers.
- Fixed directory structure in JAR file format, which was causing problems for some tools.

- Better error messages for some common URI misspellings.

## 0.8.3438: 2012/08/22

Fixed bug in `:db/txInstant` that prevented backdating before db was created.

## 0.8.3435: 2012/08/21

- New API: `Peer.resolveTempid` provides the actual database ids corresponding to temporary ids submitted in a transaction.
- Changed API: you can now explicitly specify the `:db/txInstant` of a transaction. This facilitates backdating transactions during data imports.
- Changed API: transaction futures now return a map with DB_BEFORE, DB_AFTER, TX_DATA and TEMPIDS.
- Changed API: transaction report queues now report the same data as calls to `Connection.transact`.
- Changed API: transaction report TX_DATA now includes retractions in addition to assertions.
- New API: `Database.basisT` returns the t of the most recent transaction.
- Bugfix: fixed bug that prevented AWS provisioning scripts from running.

## 0.8.3423: 2012/08/16

- New API: `database.history` returns a value of a database containing all assertions and retractions across time.
- New API: `database.isHistory` returns true if a database is a history database.
- New API: `datom.added` returns true if a datom is added, false if retracted.
- Changed API: the Datom relation in a query now exposes a fifth component, containing a boolean that is true for adds, false for retracts.
- Changed API: removed `Index` class, range capability now available directly from `Database`.
- Bugfix: calling `keys` on an entity with no current attributes no longer throws NPE.
- Updated to use the recent (12.0.1) version of Google Guava.
- When a peer calls `deleteDatabase`, shut down that peer's connection.

## 0.8.3397: 2012/08/07

- Fixed bug where some recursive queries returned partial results.
- Simplified license key install: pro license keys are installed via a `license-key` entry in the transactor properties file.
- Connection catalog lookup is cached, so it is inexpensive to call `Peer.connect` as often as you like.
- Improved fulltext indexing and query performance.

## 0.8.3372: 2012/07/31

- Changed API: query clauses are considered in order.
- Changed API: when navigating entities, references to entities that have a `db/ident` return that ident, instead of the entity.
- New API: `database.index` supports range requests.
- Fixed broken dependency that prevented datomic-pro peer jar from working with DynamoDB.
- New API: `peer.part` function returns the partition of an entity id.
- New API: `peer.toTx` and `Peer.toT` conversion functions.
