# Processing Transactions

## Processing Transactions

After a transaction data structure is built, you must submit it to the transactor for processing. The transactor queues transactions and processes them serially.

### Submitting Transactions

Once a transaction data structure is built, you submit it to the transactor by calling `transact` or `transact-async`.

In the Peer API, both functions return a Clojure future that will eventually contain the transaction's result.

In the Client API, `datomic.client.api/transact` will block until a transaction result is returned, while `datomic.client.api.async/transact` will return a core.async channel that will eventually contain the transaction's result.

### Transaction Timeouts

When a transaction times out, the peer does not know whether the transaction succeeded, and will need to query a recent value of the database to discover what happened.

### Monitoring Transactions

Peers can monitor all transactions being processed by the system's transactor. In the Peer API, [tx-report-queue](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#tx-report-queue) returns a queue of transaction notifications.

The queue delivers a report for every transaction submitted while a peer is connected to the database, even those submitted by other peers.

Reports are records with the following keys:

| key | usage |
|-----|-------|
| `:db-before` | database value before the transaction |
| `:db-after` | database value after the transaction |
| `:tx-data` | datoms produced by the transaction |
| `:tempids` | argument to [resolve-tempid](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#resolve-tempid) |

It is the responsibility of your application to empty the queue. When you are done monitoring the queue, remove it by calling [remove-tx-report-queue](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#remove-tx-report-queue) otherwise it will continue to accumulate transaction reports and consume memory.

This example shows how to connect to the notification queue, and retrieve a transaction report from it:

```clojure
(let [tx-report-q (d/tx-report-queue conn)
      tx          (.poll tx-report-q)]
  (d/remove-tx-report-queue conn)
  tx)
```

The `tx-data` of a transaction report contains the set of datoms created by a transaction (both assertions and retractions). The `tx-data` can be used as an input source for a query. The query below uses the `tx-data` and the database value after the transaction was applied to show each datom of the transaction.

```clojure
[:find ?e ?aname ?v ?added
 :in $ [[?e ?a ?v _ ?added]]
 :where
 [?e ?a ?v _ ?added]
 [?a :db/ident ?aname]]
```

The query expects the `db-after` and `tx-data` values of a transaction report as its two input sources, in that order.

Check [Query](../../03-query-and-pull/02-query-reference/query-reference.md#relation-binding) for more information on using sets of tuples as input sources in queries.
