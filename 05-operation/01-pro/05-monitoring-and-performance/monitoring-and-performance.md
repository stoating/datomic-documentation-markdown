can include up to five different statistics: *samples*, *average*, *minimum*, *maximum*, and
*sum*.

## Tuning Tips

### Give your peers and transactor enough memory

You can set the maximum memory available to a JVM process with the
*-Xmx* flag to java (or to bin/transactor). The more memory you give a
process, the more database indexes it will be able to cache locally in
memory, avoiding trips to Memcached or storage.

### Use Memcached

Memcached is a [great fit for Datomic](https://blog.datomic.com/2012/07/memcache.html). Read more about configuring
Memcached in the [caching documentation](../08-memory-and-caching/memory-and-caching.md).

### Give memcached enough memory

Memcached can deliver data to peers with very low latency (on the
order of 1 millisecond for a segment). If you can fit your entire
database (or even the commonly-used working set) in Memcached, your
read and query performance will be quite good.

Diagnostic: if your *[Memcache]* average is substantially less than 1.0,
then you can serve more reads from Memcache by increasing the size of
your memcached cluster.

### Add More Peers

Datomic reads and queries are horizontally scalable. If you can't serve as
many simultaneous queries as you like, add more peers.

### Add More Cores

Datomic's entire public API is threadsafe and is designed to
automatically take advantage of multiple cores where available. Having
more cores will help any Datomic process, transactor, or peer.

### Don't Benchmark Against the Memory Database

The memory database is a convenience for development, testing, and
temp data. Memory is not good for storage-sized datasets, as memory
isn't storage-sized.

### Provision Enough DynamoDB Capacity

Check the DynamoDB section of [capacity planning](../04-capacity-planning/capacity-planning.md).

### Run Large Imports on Cheap Storage, Then Backup/Restore

[Restoring](../07-backup-and-restore/backup-and-restore.md) a database consumes significantly less write capacity than
building the database via transactions. So if your target system has
metered storage pricing (e.g. DynamoDB), it may make sense to do large
import jobs on less expensive storage, backup, and then restore to the
target storage.

### Use Metrics to Analyze Write Activity

The speed with which a Datomic transactor can write data is measured
with the *[TransactionMsec]* metric. The minimum, average, and maximum
values of this metric, combined with the size of your transactions,
characterize the write latency of the system from the transactor's
perspective. (To measure write latency from a peer or client's
perspective, instrument your code to measure the time from when
[transact](../../../04-apis/01-peer-api-clojuredoc/peer-api-clojuredoc.md#transact) is called until the transaction future is realized).

The *[TransactionBytes]* samples metric, again combined with the size of
your transactions characterize the write throughput of the system.
Note that to achieve maximum throughput you will need to pipeline
transactions, i.e. arrange to have multiple transactions in flight at
the same time.

## Custom Monitoring

You can integrate custom monitoring in both transactors and peers by
registering a callback. The callback must be on the JVM process's
classpath, so you will need to modify your deployment to e.g. include
any necessary JARs and resources in the transactor's *lib* directory of the
standard transactor.

Callbacks are registered via the *datomic.metricsCallback* Java system
property in the peer or transactor, or via the *metrics-callback*
setting in the transactor properties file.

### Register Callback on the Transactor

Register the callback for the transactor in the properties file:

```
metrics-callback=my.ns/handler
```

### Register callback on the peer

Register the callback for the peer with the command line argument:

```
-Ddatomic.metricsCallback=my.ns/handler
```

### Java callbacks

Java callbacks must be static public methods, taking a single *Object*
argument, named as my.pkg.CallbackClass.handler, e.g.

```sh
metrics-callback=my.pkg.CallbackClass.handler
```

### Clojure Callbacks

Clojure callbacks must be functions that can take a single argument,
named as my.ns/handler, e.g.

```sh
metrics-callback=my.ns/handler
```

### Callback Argument Format

The callback argument format is alpha and is subject to change.
Currently, the argument is a map with keyword keys and either number
or map values. If the value is itself a map, it will contain *:lo*,
*:hi*, *:sum*, and *:count* components, all with numeric values.

The example below shows `:HeartbeatMsec` with a map value, and
`:AvailableMB` with a numeric value:

```clojure
{:HeartbeatMsec {:lo 5000, :hi 5001, :sum 55009, :count 11}, :AvailableMB 921.0}
```

The metrics are the same as those reported to CloudWatch. Note that
the set of metrics is dynamic, open, and subject to change over
time. A correct callback implementation should be tolerant of:

- Metric names it has never seen before
- Metric values in either of the shapes documented above, regardless
  of what shapes it has seen previously

## Configuring CloudWatch Monitoring

The Datomic Pro transactor can be configured to write metrics to
[CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). Find instructions
for setting up CloudWatch [here](../11-running-on-aws/running-on-aws.md#s3-log-storage).

## Use CloudWatch From Anywhere

Note that you can use CloudWatch with any Datomic Pro transactor,
regardless of which storage you are using, and regardless of where
your transactor is located. Instructions for configuring CloudWatch
for storages other than DynamoDB are [here](../11-running-on-aws/running-on-aws.md#other-storages).

## Available CloudWatch Metrics

### Metrics Outside of AWS

If you're analyzing metrics through your own custom callback, or manually
calculating statistics from the log, you may need to take additional steps to
interpret metrics. The most common case is producing your average by
dividing a *sum* value for a metric by its *count* value.

### Example Using Memcache

If you're looking at *memcache* metrics outside of AWS, you would interpret it as follows:

- *count* is the number of requests to Memcached
- *sum* is the total number of hits
- You would manually calculate misses as *count* minus *sum*
- You would manually calculate your hit rate as *sum* divided by *count*,
  producing, e.g., a value like 0.95

## Alarms

Cloudwatch allows you to create alarms when a Cloudwatch metric's
value is outside of a predetermined range for a defined time period.
Alarms can then send a notification to a pager or email, or trigger an
Auto Scaling action to expand or contract some resource.

Datomic transactors have a **metric** named *[Alarm]*. This metric
indicates that something has gone wrong with a transactor, and that
human intervention is likely to be necessary. When deploying Datomic
in production, you should create a Cloudwatch alarm that notifies you
if the Datomic *[Alarm]* count is ever nonzero.

Each Datomic *[Alarm]* is accompanied by a more specific metric whose
name is prefixed with *[Alarm]*. You can use these more specific alarms
to plan your response to the problem, as shown in the table below.

| Alarm | Recommended action |
|-------|--------------------|
| AlarmIndexingJobFailed | Check for storage problems |
| AlarmBackPressure | Let import finish, increase [capacity](../04-capacity-planning/capacity-planning.md) |
| AlarmUnhandledException | Contact Datomic support |
| Alarm{AnythingElse} | Contact Datomic support |

## Internal Monitoring

Metrics and events not documented above are *internal* to
Datomic. Internal monitoring is implementation-specific and subject
to change at any time. Do not build systems that rely
on internal monitoring.

The descriptions of internal metrics and events below are provided for
informational purposes only.

*AlarmStorageSemaphoreTimeout* is an internal metric that occurs after
a bounding timeout reading or writing
storage. *AlarmStorageSemaphoreTimeout* can occur if Datomic is
waiting tens of seconds to hear back from a storage call, and will
likely correlate with spikes in [documented metrics](#transactor-metrics) such as
*StorageGetMsec* or *StoragePutMsec*. After an
*AlarmStorageSemaphoreTimeout*, check for problems in storage or the
network between a Datomic process and storage.
